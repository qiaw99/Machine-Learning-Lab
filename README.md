# Machine-Learning-Lab
Machine Learning Lab Course at TU Berlin in SS2022

# Content 
The aim of this course is to practice the implementation of learning algorithms, the analysis of machine learning methods in simulations and their application to real data. The course covers both unsupervised learning (**PCA, LLE, clustering, outlier detection**) and supervised learning (**kernel ridge regression, cross-validation, support vector machines**).
